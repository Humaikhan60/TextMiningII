# Step 1: Read the R script file and display its content
file_content <- readLines("exercises/import.R")

# Display the content of the file (optional)
cat(file_content, sep = "\n")

# Step 2: Execute each line of code one by one
for (line in file_content) {
  # Trim whitespace from the line
  clean_line <- trimws(line)
  
  # Check if the line is not empty and is not a comment (ignoring lines starting with '#')
  if (nzchar(clean_line) && !grepl("^#", clean_line)) {
    # Parse and evaluate the line
    eval(parse(text = clean_line))
  }
}

# Step 3: Option to source the entire file at once if desired
# If you want to execute the entire script at once, you can uncomment the following line:
# source("exercises/import.R")
